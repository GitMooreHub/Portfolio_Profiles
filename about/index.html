                <p>I have in-depth knowledge of ceramics, polymers and metals and their characteristics. I possess a solid understanding of materials related to mechanical and chemical engineering theory and principles. Able to build practical simulations and models using integrated software relating to real-world problems. Ability to understand and work with phase diagrams. Skilled in forming aqueous reaction diagrams related to waste management. Outstanding capability to resolve complex problems relating to material or product design. Competent to manage technical projects and work confidently with a manufacturing design team. I am a demonstrated leader in the academic and manufacturing fields. I have efficiently coordinated services and objectives for multiple technicians. I am skillful in technical writing for processes, safety, and design.</p>
<p>Some things that I have come to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fail and fail often, because this is the true representation of forging something new.</li>
<li>Wanting to do something good in the world is the first step to making anything good in the world.</li>
<li>Many people present a problem, but seldom are the true heroes who present the solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not afraid to fail in doing something good when trying to solve a problem. This is where I take my pleasure. It is a challenge to me, to fix and improve.</p>
<p>Many people can see and proclaim the problems, however, the truth is, this isn&rsquo;t what makes an analytical assessor succeed. It&rsquo;s the ability to take one problem and turn it into, 3, 4 or many, potential, affordable, and simple solutions, with supporting evidence to make it succeed. I will be the kind of engineer and scientist that can do this.</p>
