            <div class="post-content">
                <p>As a materials engineer with expertise in ceramics, polymers, and metals, I have a deep understanding of their unique properties and how they can be used in mechanical and chemical engineering applications. My experience in building practical simulations and models using integrated software allows me to tackle real-world problems with ease. I am adept at analyzing phase diagrams and forming aqueous reaction diagrams to support waste management efforts. Additionally, I possess exceptional problem-solving skills, enabling me to deliver innovative material and product designs. In my previous roles, I have successfully managed technical projects and worked collaboratively with manufacturing design teams. I am a proven leader in the academic and manufacturing sectors, having effectively coordinated services and objectives for multiple technicians. Finally, I am skilled in technical writing for processes, safety, and design.</p>

                <p>Additionally, as a self-taught, experienced software developer, I am highly skilled in Java, with knowledge of Java tools such as Sockets. I am also proficient in Python, including the use of popular libraries like Django, Seaborn, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. I have created physical models and reports using internally collected data to predict material processing behavior and characteristics, demonstrating a deep understanding of data analysis and machine learning techniques. I have experience with SQL and have worked with Node.Js and Javascript. My knowledge extends beyond technical skills, as I am also knowledgeable of team application development techniques such as Agile and Scrum methodologies. My diverse skill set and experience make me a valuable asset to any organization looking for a talented and versatile software developer.</p>
